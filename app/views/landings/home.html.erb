      Intended as an introduction that you give to non-Magic-playing friends, it explains dozens of ways to enjoy the culture (many of which are free and most of which are affordable).  The e-book explains some of the reasons the game is so much fun, while also giving hints on how to join in with minimal hassle.

      Magic: The Gathering was first published almost 25 years ago.  It rapidly spread around the globe and, after its designers incorporated lessons that resulted from its unexpected popularity, it has surged to a new peak.  There are probably 10 million players in the US and another 10 million globally.
