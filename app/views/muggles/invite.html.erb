    My goal is to make these online resources worth more than the price.  I understand that money is tight.  If you can't spend another $<%= ENV['CURRENT_BOOK_PRICE'].to_i / 100%>, you can still invite your friend to read the <%= link_to 'lists', lists_path %> on the site.

    Thanks for your purchase, and be sure to stay in touch so we can keep strengthening the community together.
